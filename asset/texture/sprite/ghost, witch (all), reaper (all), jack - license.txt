HALLOWEEN GRAPHICS

===


Hello! Thank you for downloading this mini asset pack.

The graphics in this pack were all originally made for my patreon supporters, over the past two years.
I've gathered them all here together for a themed release for Halloween.

Thanks!

UPDATE: 10/31/2019

Happy Halloween 2019! I've updated the pack to include this year's releases: 
skulls and dancing skeletons for Day of the Dead!

I've also added a new battler monster that was contributed by Tyler Warren! 
It matches the Headless Horseman sprite.

UPDATE: 10/30/2022

Happy Halloween 2022! Been a while since I've updated this set.

I added new full-character sheets for the Day of the Dead skeletons! 
They're now complete characters.

This is a mini-pack that includes a bunch of pixel art assets themed around Halloween and the Day of the Dead. I'm releasing this set as a special free download for everybody.

These are all graphics that I've previously shared on patreon over the past two years. I'm excited to release these for a larger audience.

Includes:

    Halloween Tiles
    Halloween Icons
    Blood Spatter Tiles
    Witch Sprite
    Ghost Sprite
    Grim Reaper Sprites
    Pumpkinhead Sprite with variations including a Headless Horseman
    Vampire (Male and Female), with Bat and Transformation Animation

UPDATE (Halloween 2019):

    Day of the Dead Skulls Tiles
    Day of the Dead Dancing Skeletons Sprites
    BONUS: Headless Horseman/Pumpkinhead Battler by Tyler Warren

UPDATE (DotD 2022):

    Day of the Dead Full-Character Walking Sprites

I hope you get a lot of use out of these. Even though they're compiled around a Halloween theme, you can get use out of these graphics all-year round. Some of them originally weren't even designed for Halloween, but I included them because they were a good fit for the spooky theme! This pack will be useful for expanding your Time Fantasy world!

Have a safe and fun Halloween!
