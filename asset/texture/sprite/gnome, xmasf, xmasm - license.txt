CHRISTMAS GRAPHICS

===


Hello! Thank you for downloading this mini asset pack.

The graphics in this pack were all originally made for my patreon supporters, over the past two years.
I've gathered them all here together for a themed release for the holidays.

This is a mini-pack that includes a bunch of Christmas-themed graphics. I'm releasing this set as a special free download for everybody.

These are all graphics that I've previously shared on patreon over the past two years. I'm excited to release these for a larger audience.

Includes:

    Christmas Tiles - Tree, Wreaths, etc
    Christmas Presents (with opening animations)
    Igloo Tiles
    Santa and Mrs. Claus Sprites
    Jesus Sprite
    Little Gnomes/Elves Sprites
    Reindeer Sprites (child and adult-- and Rudolph!)

UPDATED New graphics from the 2019 Christmas Releases:

    Christmas Toys Tiles (soldier, rocking horse, doll, etc)
    Santa's Sleigh Tiles
    Snowman Tiles

All graphics also come in sizes for use in RPG Maker VX and MV.

I hope you get a lot of use out of these. Even though they're compiled around a Christmas theme, you can get use out of these graphics all-year round. This pack will be useful for expanding your Time Fantasy world!

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
